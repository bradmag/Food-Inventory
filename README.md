# Food-Inventory

## Goals:
1. Create a food inventory (list of food that prioritizes food that is going bad first)
2. When Objects are removed from the Inventory (eaten or went bad) add them to the shopping list
3. When things are removed from the shopping list (purchased) add them to the Inventory.
4. Create options for cooking individual Items
5. Create options for cooking the top two/three items on the list
6. If there is a recipe and an ingredient is not in the inventory recommend buying it. 

## Notes:
1. The main class is currently used mostly for testing different Methods and classes created.
